-Instructions:
1. Load the data Auto.csv and preprocess the data. It is also possible to include the text information.
2. With "mpg" as the target, build predictors using the lesson learned in this class. Alternatively, you can try to predict one or more categories such as origin (Asia, Europe, or America).
3. Train the model and test it on a seperated testing portion.
4. Evaluate and visualize the predictors' performance. 

-The submission will be a notebook (.ipynb), with sufficient explanation like the class materials. The total points for the final project is 60.

-Please use the "Auto.csv" dataset. 
This dataset was taken from the StatLib library, which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. 
The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. 
The data set has 392 observations with 9 variables.
